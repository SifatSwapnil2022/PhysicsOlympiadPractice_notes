Qns 1 : A body revolves around a circular path of radius in time . What are the speed
and velocity of the body?


ans :  speed , v = d/t ; where d = 2 * pi * r [where d is the distance traveled in one complete revolution]
                = 2 *pi * r / t


        velocity, has 1)Magnitude| 2 *pi * r / t | 
                      2)direction(Tangential )

qns 2 : A physical quantity is inversely proportional to the 5th power of length, directly
proportional to the square of mass and directly proportional to temperature. What
are the dimensions of this quantity?

[Q]= M ^2  * L ^−5 * T


qns 3 : A U-tube of cross-sectional area is filled with a liquid of density . After a
cylinder is placed on one side of the tube, the situation becomes like that shown
in the figure. What is the weight of the cylinder? 

W=ρgh=ρgAΔh


qns:4 The person in the figure is  10m rom the center. Speed of sound is 350 m/s.Calculate the time between echoes. 
v = 2*d/t = 2* 10 / 350 = 0.0571s
