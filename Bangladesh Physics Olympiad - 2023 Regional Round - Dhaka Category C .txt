***  There is a layer of oil(750 kgm-3 density) below a layer of water of 20 cm(1000 kgm-3 density)
in a glass. What will be the velocity of an oil droplet when it reaches the top of the glass?g=10
ms-2

ans :  F = (Pw - Po ) VG ;
       a = F/m = F/V Po
  V^2 = U^2 + 2.a.S


***  What should be the resistance of the 8 ohm resistor so that the thermal power of that resistor is
maximum?
 I = V/ R total
p = I ^ R

***  There are 2022 point charges, each with charge q, located at a vertex of a regular polygon of
2023 sides. Another point charge Q is located at the center of the polygon. The distance from the
center of the regular polygon to its vertices is a. Find the force experienced by Q.

 F = K (qQ)/r^2
The force experienced by the central charge 
ùëÑ
Q will be zero because the contributions from all the individual point charges at the vertices cancel out due to the symmetry of the system
